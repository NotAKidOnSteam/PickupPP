# PickupOverrides
This mod allows to override certain pickup settings. Currently it only supports overriding the Auto-Hold settings.

With Auto-Hold set to `true` all pickups will stick to your hand once you grab them. To release you need to:
 - Press `G` on your keyboard (if playing in desktop)
 - Hold the `grip` while pulling the `thumbstick down` on your **right** controller (if playing in VR).

If the Auto-Hold is set to `false` the pickup will be released as soon as you stop holding it.

Currently the only way to change whether you want Auto-Hold or not is through Melon Config. The config is located at
`<game_folder>\UserData\MelonPreferences.cfg`. You can edit the config while the game and it will take effect as soon
as you save the config file.
